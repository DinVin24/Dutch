# Dutch

## Setup
- Each player is dealt 4 cards face down.
- Players may look at any 2 of their cards at the start of the game.
- Cards remain face down for the rest of the game.

## Turns
- Draw a card from the deck and look at it.
- Decide if you either:
  - Discard it onto the pile.
  - Swap it with one of your face-down cards.

## Special Moves
- Jump-in:
  If a player knows they have a card that matches the last one that was discarded, they can discard it, even if it isn't their turn.
  - If the card is a match, you get to discard it.
  - If the card isn't a match, you keep it and also draw a new card without looking at it.
- Special cards:
  - Queen -> Look at any card on the table
  - Jack -> Swap any two cards on the table

- Points per card:
  - Ace = 1, Two = 2, ..., Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13

## Winning
