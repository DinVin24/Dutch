# Dutch
Card game
Each player gets dealt 4 cards face down. They remain face down throughout the entire game. 
They get to check only 2 of them.

When it's your turn, you pull and look at a card from the deck. You decide to either discard
it in the pile or replace it with one of your cards (without looking at it).

If you or someone else discarded a card and you know you have a match, you can jump in and discard it. If the card you jumped in isn't a match, you keep it and pull another one without looking at it. 

If the card you discarded is a Queen, you can look at any card on the table.
If the card you discarded is a Jack, you can swap any two cards on the table.

The goal of the game is to have 7 or less points. Each card has their respective amount of points (Ace - 1, Two - 2, ... , Jack - 11, Queen - 12, King - 13). The king of diamonds has 0 points, it's the lowest card.
When you think you have enough points, you call out "Dutch" when it's your turn. Then the game plays for one more round. When it's your turn again, you choose to keep the "Dutch", ending the game. Or you can cancel it and the game continues. Each player can call out "Dutch" only once.
When the game is over, each player reveals their cards and the least amount of points win. If players have the same amount of points, the one with least cards wins. 

You can win the game by either having the least amount of points or by discarding all of your cards.
